Version 4.1.6
=============
Brown paper bag release.  Fix a problem with header inclusion that could
prevent the library from building on some platforms.

Version 4.1.5
=============
This version has some important fixes for segfaults when working with corrupt
files.  All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Code Fixes
----------
* Fix segfault in utilities due to referencing ColorMaps in GifFiles that had
  no ColorMap present.
* Fix gif2x11 to work on 24 bit displays.
* Fix for giftext segfault when the GifFile does not store a global colormap.
* Checks to fail gracefully when an image contains improper LZ codes.
* Close file handles on failure in DGifOpenFileHandle()
* Checks to operate on files in binary mode on WIN32 as well as MSDOS.

Building
--------
* Add checks to make building on Win32 easier.
* Allow turning off gl_s, rle, and X11 support from the configure command line.
* Fix for finding a 32 bit integer type on some platforms.
* Only enable -Wall if we're using gcc.

Version 4.1.4
=============
This version fixes some bugs with deallocating ColorMaps.  Fix building on
several platforms.  Fix x86_64 builds to not hang the encoder.

* Fix several areas in decoding where we removed a ColorMap from our GifFile
  but didn't set the pointer to NULL.  This could lead to double free's of
  the ColorMap.
* Fix a bug in dev2gif.c where we redefined some gl types incorrectly.
* Fix a bug in the gif LZW encoder that was triggered on modern 64 bit
  platforms.
* Fix building on Windows.  Note -- there has been one API changing event for
  Windows (renaming DrawText to DrawGifText.)  This should have conflicted with
  Windows API and therefore caused the builds to fail previously.  If you had
  it working with DrawText before, apologies, you'll need to change to
  DrawGifText in your code.  This only affects Windows.
* Add support for building on The Game Boy Advance.  Note: Due to the GBA's
  limited memory, the API for the GBA uses short's in many places where the
  other platforms use ints.  This shouldn't affect anyone unless you've
  been able to get an older version of the code to run on GBA and want to
  start using this version instead.  A recompile of your dependent code
  will be necessary in this case.

Version 4.1.3
=============
This version fixes some bugs in the Extension writing code in
EGifPutExtensionFirst, Next, and Last.  Using these functions, it is possible
to output extensions that contain multiple subblocks.  Additionally, library
code has been updated to use these functions, making it safe to output
long Comments, and multi-block extensions read in from another file.

* giflib is now hosted on sourceforge with libungif:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libungif
* Make the EGifPutExtension{First,Next,Last} family of functions use WRITE
  so user defined WRITE methods will output them correctly.
* Modify EGifSpew and EGifPutComment to use EGifPutExtension{First,Next,Last}
  so we won't output broken GIFs when dealing with GIFs with multiple
  subblocks.
* More -Wall fixes revealed while testing on Solaris and FreeBSD.
* Updated the gif_lib.html documentation to not use EGifPutExtension when
  dealing with multiple subblocks.  Use EGifPutExtension{First,Next,Last}
  instead.
* Some Windows code from the old CVS repository now available in the windows
  subdirectory.  I don't have a Windows environment to test and maintain this
  but maybe someone out there will find it useful.  Caveat hacker.

Version 4.1.2
===============
* Numerous bug fixes from people on the old libungif mailing list.
* GIF_ERROR and GIF_MESSAGE are on the deprecation list as they are also
  utility helper functions rather than essential to the functioning of the
  library.
* Complete deprecation list is now in the README file
* Audited the sources with gcc -Wall. Everything detectable has now been fixed.
* Ran the library code through indent.
  
Version 4.1.1
=============
* Merge in many bug fixes that were sent in while I was hiking the
  Appalachian Trail.
* The qprintf methods of the library are now deprecated.  Do not use 
  GifQuietPrint or GifQprintf.  These should have been pushed out into the
  utility helper library instead of sitting around in the library proper at
  the same time as the getarg functions were moved out.  Getting rid of these
  will let us get rid of our dependence on stdarg.h/varargs.h (Which a Gif
  reading library has no business requiring.)

Version 4.1.0
============
* Several minor memory leaks in error conditions have been plugged.
* New Function EGifOpen(void *userData, OutputFunc writeFunc) allows user
  specified gif writing functions.
* Old copyright notices in a few source files have been updated.  All library
  copyrights should now reflect the copyright notice in the COPYING file.

Version 4.0.0 -- giflib
=======================
This version of the giflib library merges Eric Raymond's giflib-3.0 release
with the libungif-4.0 release to give people a binary compatible choice
between the two libraries and gives me the chance to add bugfixes to giflib
that have been incorporated in libungif.

PLEASE READ THE FILE PATENT_PROBLEMS BEFORE USING THIS LIBRARY!

Version 4.0.0
=============
Major fixes have been made to the code that handles Extensions.
Unfortunately, this causes binary incompatibility with giflib-3.0 and
libungif-3.x.  However, the API is still intact.  I am, however, deprecating
the use of saveImage[x].Function.  Use
saveImage[x].ExtensionBlocks[y].Function instead.

Version 3.1.1
=============
 The following bugs which caused SegFaults have been fixed:
 * When reading gif files with extensions, DGifSlurp would violate memory.
 * When closing a gif that had a local colormap, DGifCloseFile would attempt
   to free the colormap twice.
 * Fix a potential memory leak in DGifSlurp.
The following enhancements have been made:
 * New function DGifOpen to allow specifying a user definable gif reading
   function.

Version 3.1.0
=============
 * Add a new function:
        GifFileType *DGifOpen(void * userData, InputFunc readFunc)
   to read the gif image from a user defined input function.
 * A few bugfixes.

Version 3.0
===========
Changes from Eric Raymond's libgif:
 * A new gif encoder that makes uncompressed gifs rather than standard,
   LZW-compressed gifs.  This is actually the major motivating factor behind
   libungif; to provide third-party distributors a means to provide a gif
   library without the patented LZW encoder.

 * A new configure script to make compilation of the library on multiple
   platforms easier.  The package should now build shared libraries on all
   platforms supported by GNU libtool.

 * Removed the getarg functions from libgif.  These were not part of the
   public API and only used by the tools in the utils directory so I separated
   them from the rest of the library.

 * Fixed a few bugs in the tools in the utils directory.
