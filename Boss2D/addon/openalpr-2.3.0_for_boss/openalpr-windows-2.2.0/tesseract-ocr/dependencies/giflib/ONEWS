Note: to change the version, you have to hack both Makefile and lib/Makefile.

Version 3.0:
------------

New features:
* Incorporated Sirtaj Kang's changes to make both static and shared libs.
* All the utility and library docs are HTML now.
* The library and relevant utilities are now fully GIF89-aware.
* Functions for drawing text and boxes on saved images are documented.
* The distribution is now issued under a simple X-Consortium-style license.
* Can now generate package RPMs and LSM automatically.
* Home page with Web-acessible documentation at http://www.ccil.org/~esr/giflib

Bug fixes:
* Fix giftext to not core dump on a null extension record.
* Incorporate Philip VanBaren's change to prevent a core dump in gifasm.

Version 2.3:
-------------
1. Fixed a core-dump bug in gifcomb revealed by the ELF environment in Linux
   1.2.13.

Version 2.2b:
------------
1. Added gifburst tool.

Version 2.2
-----------
1. Linux is supported.

Version 2.1
-----------
1. Added the gifovly tool, which supports making a composite from several GIF
   images.

2. Used gifovly to implement a full-fledged pasteup program in shell.  It's
   called gifcompose and lives in the util directory.

3. Added a copy of the GIF89 standard to the doc directory (gif89.txt);
   also a description of the preferred compression method (lzgif.txt).

Version 2.0
-----------
   With this version, development was taken over from Gershon Elber by Eric
S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.  Note that I, esr, have pretty much
adhered to Gershon's coding style, even though it's quite baroque and DOS-
headed by my standards.

Library Improvements

1.  New DGifSlurp() and EGifSpew() library entry points allow all GIF-bashing
    to be done in core on machines with sufficient memory.  Writing code to
    slice'n'dice multiple GIFs in non-sequential ways is now much easier (send
    kudos and brickbats to esr, small unmarked bills preferred).

2.  The interface has changed somewhat.  Members in the GifFileType structure
    have been renamed and regrouped.  This was required for support of the
    SavedImages member (which enables the new functions mentioned in 1).  Also,
    there is a new data type for allocated color maps and routines to handle
    it conveniently.

3.  Some minor bugs have been fixed.  Most notably, the DGif code now correctly
    handles the possibility of more than one code block per extension record,
    as per the GIF spec.  It's not clear, however, that anyone ever has or
    ever will use this feature for anything...

New Tools and Options

4.  A brand new, ultra-spiffy tool `icon2gif' is included.  It assembles named
    GIFs with editable text color map & icon raster representations to produce
    multi-image GIFs usable as graphical resource files.  It can also dump most
    GIFs in the same text-only form it parses.  This makes it easy to edit GIFs
    even if you don't have a graphics editor.

5.  The gifclip utility supports a new `-c' (complement) option that allows you
    to perform an `inverse clip', removing horizontal or vertical bands from an
    image.

6.  The gifclrmp utility supports a new `-t' switch for shuffling color index
    values.

7.  A new tool `gifcolor' generates test pattern from colormap input.

New Documentation and Examples

8.  The documentation has been overhauled completely and translated out of the
    dialect spoken by the estimable Mr. Elber into something like standard
    English :-).

9.  Two source code files gifspnge.c and giffiltr.c have been added to the
    util directory.  These are GIF copiers that exercise the I/O routines,
    provided as skeletons for your applications.  Read the comments in them
    for more info.

10. The util Makefile for UNIX has been improved.  It now uses the cc/gcc -s
    option rather than strip(1).  There are now separate install productions,
    so you can test new versions in util before installation for production
    (the top-level make script still does an install).


Version 1.2
-----------
1. GIFFIX - a new tool to attempt and fix broken GIF images. Currently fix
   images that has EOF prematurely by padding with the darkest color.
2. Make GIF2BGI display as much as it can considering the mem. avail.
3. Add -q flag to all tools for quite running scan line number mode.
4. Fix a (minor!?) bug in the GIF decoder when encountering code 4095.
5. New tools (RGB2GIF and GIF2RGB) to convert GIF to/from 24 bits RGB images.
6. New tool GIFROTAT to rotate a gif image by an arbitrary angle.
7. GifRSize was updated to resize by an arbitrary factor.

Version 1.1
-----------
1. GIF2BGI - a new utility to display GIF images using Borland's BGI drivers
   (if you have one...)
2. TEXT2GIF - Converts plain text into GIF images.
3. GIF2IRIS - SGI4D display program for GIF images.
4. GIF_LIB naming convension has been modified to make sure it has unique
   names (see gif_lib.h).
5. Support for SGI4D gl and X11 window grabbing has been added to the
   library. SGI4D input is quantizied into 8 bits.
   Also support for EGA/VGA devices has been added as well.
   see Dev2gif.c module.
6. Support for the new gif89a format has been added.
