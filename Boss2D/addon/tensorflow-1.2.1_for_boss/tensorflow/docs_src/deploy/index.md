# Deploy

This section focuses on deploying real-world models.  It contains
the following documents:

  * @{$distributed$Distributed TensorFlow}, which explains how to create
    a cluster of TensorFlow servers.
  * @{$tfserve$TensorFlow Serving}, which describes TensorFlow Serving--an
    open-source serving system for machine learning models. This document
    provides a short introduction to TensorFlow Serving; the bulk of the
    documentation about TensorFlow Serving is in a
    [separate website](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/serving_basic).
  * @{$hadoop$How to run TensorFlow on Hadoop}, which has a highly
    self-explanatory title.
