## Support

TensorFlow provides multiple communication paths.  To pick the right path,
please read the following list carefully:

  * To ask or answer technical questions about TensorFlow, use
    [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow).
    For example, ask or search Stack Overflow about a particular error message
    you encountered during installation.
  * To join general discussions about TensorFlow development and directions,
    please join the
    [TensorFlow discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/discuss).
    For example, use this mailing list to learn about new features in
    upcoming releases of TensorFlow.
  * To report bugs or make feature requests, use the
    [TensorFlow issues tracker](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues)
    on GitHub.  For example, use the issue tracker to request a
    new operation in TensorFlow.
