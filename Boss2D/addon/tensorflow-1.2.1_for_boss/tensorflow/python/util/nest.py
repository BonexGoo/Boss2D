"""## Functions for working with arbitrarily nested sequences of elements.

This module is used to perform any operations on nested structures. A nested
structure is a Python sequence that contains non-sequence elements or other
sequences. The utilities here assume (and do not check) that the nested
structures form a 'tree', i.e. no references in the structure of the input of
these functions should be recursive.

Example structures: `((3, 4), 5, (6, 7, (9, 10), 8))`, `(np.array(0),
  (np.array([3, 4]), tf.constant([3, 4])))`
