DeepSpeech code owners
======================

This file describes reviewers who are active on the project and which parts of the code they have expertise on (and interest in). If you're making changes to the code and are wondering who's an appropriate person to talk to, this list will tell you who to ping.

There's overlap in the areas of expertise of each reviewer, and in particular when looking at which files are covered by each area, there is a lot of overlap. Don't worry about getting it exactly right when requesting review, any code owner will be happy to redirect the request to a more appropriate question.

Global reviewers
----------------

These are people who have worked on the project extensively and are familiar with all or most parts of it. Their expertise and review guidance is trusted by other code owners to cover their own areas of expertise. In case of conflicting opinions from other reviewers, global reviewers will make a final decision.
