AbcView is a graphical Alembic inspection, visualization and scene assembly
tool. It offers a number of widgets to help you inspect and visualize your
Alembic data, and assemble hierarchical scenes.

- Widgets for inspecting Alembic objects
- Hierarchical scene assembly (IO file format)
- Deferred loading for all Alembic objects
- Python console for closer inspection of Alembic objects
- Playback or step through animation using the Timeline widget
- Per-camera render modes (box, fill, line, point)

The repo contains both the current PyQt-based AbcView and a work-in-progress
C++ conversion. The C++ version is much faster, but does not yet support all
of the same features as the current PyQt version.
