            Introduction</h2>
        The ZipArchive Library is distributed in two versions: the Open Source (GNU GPL)
        Version and the Full Version. The Full Version requires purchasing the commercial
        license and the Open Source (GNU GPL) version may require it. Having the commercial
        license of the ZipArchive Library has the following benefits in both cases:
        <ul>
            <li>The commercial license allows you to embed the ZipArchive Library in proprietary
                software without affecting the copyright of this software</li>
            <li>The license gives you royalty free distribution rights.</li>
            <li>The license is granted per developer, team or site.</li>
            <li>The upgrades of the ZipArchive Library are free.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="open" name="open" class="kb">
            Open Source (GNU GPL) Version</h2>
        The Open Source (GNU GPL) Version is licensed under the <a class="linkkb" href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
        Distributing the ZipArchive Library under GNU GPL implies, that the ZipArchive Library
        can only be used by software that is licensed under conditions compliant with the
        GNU GPL. One of these conditions is <b>an obligation to make the source code of the
            software publicly available</b>. If you find this condition not suitable for
        your software, you can obtain <a class="linkindex" href="#commercial">the commercial
            license for using the ZipArchive Library</a> that removes this obligation.

            Freeware and Shareware</h4>
        The commercial license can be granted free of charge for using the ZipArchive Library
        in:
        <ul>
            <li>Freeware software <em>(freeware is software that is available free of charge, but
                which is copyrighted by the developer, who retains the right to control its redistribution
                and to sell it in the future)</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excluded is software that has no practical usage without purchasing an additional
                        product(s) from the same company (such as software associated with an equipment
                        or service that the same company provides). It is considered in this case that the
                        software is part of another, priced product and the software is not freeware.</li>
                    <li>If you decide to sell the software in the future - you will need to purchase the
                        commercial license for using the ZipArchive library, unless the software meets the
                        conditions for the software distributed in the shareware way - see below.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Software distributed in the Shareware way <em>(Shareware distribution gives users
                a chance to try software before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
                using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs differ on details --
                some request registration while others require it, some specify a maximum trial
                period. Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software and the copyright
                holder retains all rights, with the exception that copying and distributing the
                program for evaluation purposes is encouraged, subject to certain conditions. For
                example, some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor
                may copy their Shareware. )</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excluded is software which the price for a single copy is higher than the price
                        of the ZipArchive Library for a single developer.</li>

            Extended License for HBZLIB from the Harbour Project</h4>
        HBZLIB is a library for zip compression in <a class="linkindex" href="http://www.harbour-project.org" target="_blank">the Harbour Project</a>. You can create proprietary software
        using HBZLIB respecting the follow:
        <ul>
            <li>The ZipArchive Library must be linked together with HBZLIB. </li>
            <li>You cannot use the ZipArchive Library as a dynamic library (DLL), it must be linked
                statically with the software.</li>
            <li>The commercial license for the ZipArchive Library is free of charge, but these grants
                are valid only if the whole application is written with Harbour.</li>
