                WARNING:
            </p>
            <p>
                This program and library (attempts to) compress data by performing several non-trivial transformations on it. Unless you
                are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms contained herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, you should NOT
                meddle with the compression or decompression machinery. Incorrect changes can and very likely *will* lead to disastrous
                loss of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                DISCLAIMER:
            </p>
            <p>
                I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the compressed file can be decompressed to reproduce the original.
                Great efforts in design, coding and testing have been made to ensure that this program works correctly. However, the complexity
                of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various special cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero
                probability make it impossible to rule out the possibility of bugs remaining in the program. DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA WITH
                THIS PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER SMALL, THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable. Indeed, I very much hope the opposite is true. bzip2/libbzip2
                has been carefully constructed and extensively tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                PATENTS:
            </p>
            <p>
                To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any patented algorithms. However, I do not have the resources to
                carry out a patent search. Therefore I cannot give any guarantee of the above statement.
