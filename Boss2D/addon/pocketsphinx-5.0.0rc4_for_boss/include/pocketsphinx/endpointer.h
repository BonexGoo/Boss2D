 * @param ratio Ratio of frames needed to trigger start/end decision,

 * @param mode "Aggressiveness" of voice activity detection.  Stricter
 *             values (see ps_vad_mode_t) are less likely to
 *             misclassify non-speech as speech.
 * @param sample_rate Sampling rate of input, or 0 for default (which can
 *                    be obtained with ps_vad_sample_rate()).  Only 8000,
 *                    16000, 32000, 48000 are directly supported, others
 *                    will use the closest supported rate (within reason).

 *                    may not be exactly the one requested, so you must

 *                    (in samples) or ps_endpointer_frame_length() (in
 *                    seconds).
 * @param frame_length Requested frame length in seconds, or 0.0 for the
 *                     default.  Only 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 currently supported.
 *                     **Actual frame length may be different, you must
 *                     always use ps_endpointer_frame_length() to obtain it.**
